# Topic Modeling for Amazon Video Game Reviews

This is the final project for my Text Mining class. In this project, I did topic modeling for the reviews of the game "Activision: Call of Duty", which is the most controversial top-selling video game product on Amazon (no. of positive reviews/no. of negative reviews close to 1 & among the 100 games with most reviews), and found out topics that customers talks about in the reviews.

The two topics customers talk about in their positive reviews are:
1. The general gameplay, including weapon system, graphic, map, online system, story
2. The Bots and AIs in online multiplayer mode

The three topics customers talk about in their negative reviews are:
1. The general gameplay, including the multiplayer system, the spawning system, the sound, the story
2. The weapon system
3. The control
